 *
 * MSS is designed to be highly portable. Most of the MSS source codes are written
 * independently from the target platform/device. 
 *
 * There are basically only 4 files under which shall be adapted/modified when 
 * trying to port MSS to another platform/device. There are templates files which
 * can be found under <ROOT_DIRECTORY>/Source/mss/templates/target
 *
 * - dev_types.h: 
 *       contains the basic data type of the target platform. MSS uses the 
 *       standard data types which are usually supported in stdint.h and 
 *       stdbool.h. There is also some typedefs definitions which can be used
 *       to verify the correct data type assignments.
 *
 * - mss_hal.h: 
 *       contains device specific data types, macro functions and definitions
 *       which are visible to the application.
 *
 * - mss_hal_int.h: 
 *       contains device specific data types and macro definitions 
 *       which are not visible to the application.
 *
 * - mss_hal.c: 
 *       contains codes which need to be implemented according to
 *       the hardware
