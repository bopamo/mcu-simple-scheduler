<div class="textblock"><p>MSS generic (hardware independent) examples/demos used mainly for testing the MSS itself</p>
<p>The MSS Generic Examples includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>MSS_TIMER_EXAMPLE: This is a simple example application showing basic usage of MSS timer module. This example also shows how to use one physical task code for several (two) tasks. There are basically two tasks implemented, but both uses the same code task_app. The difference between the task is only the task parameter pointer passed to each task. Each task will toggle a LED with different period. If the application works correctly, LED1 should toggle every 500ms while LED2 toggling every 1000 ms.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>MSS_EVENT_EXAMPLE: This is a simple example application showing basic usage of MSS event module. There are two tasks implemented in the application: task_1 and task_2. The first task task_1 will periodically send two types of events to the task_2. The second task task_2 will toggle a LED upon receiving certain event. If the application works correctly, LED1 should toggle every 500ms while LED2 toggling every 1000 ms.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>MSS_MQUE_EXAMPLE: This is a simple example application showing basic usage of MSS message queue (mque) module. There are two tasks implemented in this example: task_1 and task_2. The second task task_2 will periodically send ASCII messages to the task_1 via the message queue. The first task task_1 will toggle a LED upon receiving certain message. If the application works correctly, LED2 should toggle every 1000ms while LED1 toggling every 500 ms.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>MSS_SEMA_EXAMPLE: This example shows a basic application example of using MSS Semaphore module. There are two tasks implemented in this module: task_1 and task_2. Each task's job is basically to toggle a LED (task_1 toggling LED1, task_2 toggling LED2) with different period. However before a task tries to turn on a LED, it will first try to wait for the created semaphore, and it will block as long as the semaphore is not available (locked by the other task). If the example runs correctly, the LED2 can only blink as long as LED1 is turned off. When LED1 is turned on, the LED2 will stay off indicating task_2 is trying to wait for the semaphore becoming available.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>MSS_PREEMPTIVE_EXAMPLE: This is a basic application showing MSS preemptive scheduling capability. There are basically three tasks in the application: int_task, higher_prio_task, and lower_prio_task. int_task has the highest priority (index 0) while lower_prio_task has the lowest priority (index 2). At the beginning, only lower_prio_task is activated (see MSS_READY_TASK_BITS_INIT). When lower_prio_task runs, it will periodically sends an event to activate higher_prio_task, but it will never release intentionally the scheduler by calling <a class="el" href="group___m_s_s___general___a_p_i.html#gad7fca9b7d54406382ea25ff40e347fff">MSS_RETURN()</a> or any other macro functions which encapsulates the <a class="el" href="group___m_s_s___general___a_p_i.html#gad7fca9b7d54406382ea25ff40e347fff">MSS_RETURN()</a>. However since the scheduler is working preemptively, it will allow the higher_prio_task to run directly after the event has been sent and it will preempt the lower_prio_task. What the higher_prio_task does is basically toggling LED2 with a delay loop without releasing the scheduler. The int_task will be activated periodically from a hardware timer interrupt. The task will also preempt either lower_prio_task or higher_prio_task and do toggling of LED1. If the demo runs correctly, the LED2 will be toggled periodically by higher_prio_task indicating higher_prio_task preempting the lower_prio_task, while sometime the LED1 toggled by int_task might also blink indicating that int_task preempting either the higher_prio_task if LED2 is turned on or the lower_prio_task if LED2 is turned off.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>MSS_FOOTPRINT_EXAMPLE: This is not a working demo, instead it is used for measuring the basic memory footprint of MSS </li>
