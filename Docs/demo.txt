 * @page     MSS_GENERIC_EXAMPLES MSS Generic Examples
 *           
 * MSS generic (hardware independent) examples/demos used mainly  for testing the MSS itself
 * 
 * The MSS Generic Examples includes:
 *
 * - MSS_TIMER_EXAMPLE:
 *           This is a simple example application showing basic usage of
 *           MSS timer module. This example also shows how to use one
 *           physical task code for several (two) tasks.
 *           There are basically two tasks implemented, but both uses the
 *           same code task_app. The difference between the task is only
 *           the task parameter pointer passed to each task. Each task
 *           will toggle a LED with different period.
 *           If the application works correctly, LED1 should toggle every
 *           500ms while LED2 toggling every 1000 ms.
 *
 * - MSS_EVENT_EXAMPLE:
 *           This is a simple example application showing basic usage of
 *           MSS event module.
 *           There are two tasks implemented in the application: task_1 and
 *           task_2. The first task task_1 will periodically send two types
 *           of events to the task_2. The second task task_2 will toggle a
 *           LED upon receiving certain event.
 *            If the application works correctly, LED1 should toggle every
 *           500ms while LED2 toggling every 1000 ms.
 * 
 * - MSS_MQUE_EXAMPLE:
 *           This is a simple example application showing basic usage of
 *           MSS message queue (mque) module.
 *           There are two tasks implemented in this example: task_1 and
 *           task_2. The second task task_2 will periodically send
 *           ASCII messages to the task_1 via the message queue. The first
 *           task task_1 will toggle a LED upon receiving certain message.
 *           If the application works correctly, LED2 should toggle every
 *           1000ms while LED1 toggling every 500 ms.
 *
 * - MSS_SEMA_EXAMPLE:
 *           This example shows a basic application example of using MSS
 *           Semaphore module.
 *           There are two tasks implemented in this module: task_1 and
 *           task_2. Each task's job is basically to toggle a LED (task_1
 *           toggling LED1, task_2 toggling LED2) with different period.
 *           However before a task tries to turn on a LED, it will first try
 *           to wait for the created semaphore, and it will block as long as
 *           the semaphore is not available (locked by the other task).
 *           If the example runs correctly, the LED2 can only blink as long
 *           as LED1 is turned off. When LED1 is turned on, the LED2 will
 *           stay off indicating task_2 is trying to wait for the semaphore
 *           becoming available.
 *
 * - MSS_PREEMPTIVE_EXAMPLE:
 *           This is a basic application showing MSS preemptive scheduling
 *           capability.
 *           There are basically three tasks in the application:
 *           int_task, higher_prio_task, and lower_prio_task. int_task has
 *           the highest priority (index 0) while lower_prio_task has the
 *           lowest priority (index 2). At the beginning, only
 *           lower_prio_task is activated (see MSS_READY_TASK_BITS_INIT).
 *           When lower_prio_task runs, it will periodically sends an event
 *           to activate  higher_prio_task, but it will never release
 *           intentionally the scheduler by calling MSS_RETURN() or any other
 *           macro functions which encapsulates the MSS_RETURN().
 *           However since the scheduler is working preemptively, it will
 *           allow the higher_prio_task to run directly after the event has
 *           been sent and it will preempt the lower_prio_task. What the
 *           higher_prio_task does is basically toggling LED2 with a delay
 *           loop without releasing the scheduler.
 *           The int_task will be activated periodically from a hardware
 *           timer interrupt. The task will also preempt either
 *           lower_prio_task or higher_prio_task and do toggling of LED1.
 *           If the demo runs correctly, the LED2 will be toggled
 *           periodically by higher_prio_task indicating higher_prio_task
 *           preempting the lower_prio_task, while sometime the LED1
 *           toggled by int_task might also blink indicating that int_task
 *           preempting either the higher_prio_task if LED2 is turned on
 *           or the lower_prio_task if LED2 is turned off.
 * 
 * - MSS_FOOTPRINT_EXAMPLE:
 *           This is not a working demo, instead it is used for measuring the
 *           basic memory footprint of MSS
